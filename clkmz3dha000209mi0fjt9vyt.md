## Python Data Types ‚å®Ô∏è

* Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data.
    
* Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
    
* Python has the following data types built-in by default: Numeric(Integer, complex, float), Sequential(string,lists, tuples), Boolean, Set, Dictionaries, etc

* To check what is the data type of the variable you used , wrtie : type(variable)

## Data Structures üèóÔ∏è

* Data Structures are a way of organizing data so that it can be accessed more efficiently depending upon the situation. Data Structures are fundamentals of any programming language around which a program is built. Python helps to learn the fundamental of these data structures in a simpler way as compared to other programming languages.

* **Lists :** Python Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.
    
    ```bash
    # we use [] to write list
    List = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    # to access list using index
    print(List[0]) # index starts from 0 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6]
    # to sort the list 
    List.sort() #sorts them in alphabetic / numeric format
    ```
    
    * Accessing elements is done through zero-based indexing, allowing for easy retrieval of specific elements.

    * Python provides a wide range of built-in methods for list manipulation, including append(), pop(), extend(), and more

    * You can learn more about lists [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lists/?ref=lbp) .
        
* **Tuple:** Python Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list but Tuples are immutable in nature i.e. the elements in the tuple cannot be added or removed once created. Just like a List, a Tuple can also contain elements of various types.

    * Unlike lists, they are immutable, Once created, tuples cannot be changed. Elements cannot be added, removed, or modified
        
        ```bash
        tuple1 = (0, 1, 2, 3)
        tuple2 = ('python', 'tuple')
         
        # Concatenating above two
        print(tuple1 + tuple2)
        ```
        
    * You can learn more about tuple [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-tuples/?ref=lbp) .
        
* **Dictionary:** Python dictionary is like hash tables in any other language with the time complexity of O(1). It is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds the key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized .
    
    * Dictionaries are not ordered collections, meaning elements are not indexed or sorted.

    * Access element using key :

        ```bash
        # to access element using key
        print(dict['key'])
        ```
        
    * You Can learn more about dictionary [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/) .
        
* **Set:** Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. They are useful when dealing with data that requires distinct values and set operations .
    
    * Like dictionaries, sets are unordered collections and do not support indexing.
