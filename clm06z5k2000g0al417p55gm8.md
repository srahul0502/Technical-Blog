Kubernetes, often lovingly called K8s, can feel like a complex spaceship dashboard. Managing all the settings for your application containers efficiently is crucial. This is where ConfigMaps and Secrets come to the rescue. Let's break these concepts down into bite-sized pieces for beginners.

# üó∫Ô∏è What Are ConfigMaps and Secrets?

## **ConfigMaps**

Think of ConfigMaps as the file cabinet for your spaceship's parts (containers). They store important settings and information neatly, like labelled folders.

### **What ConfigMaps Do:**

* Store Configuration Data: ConfigMaps save configuration data your containers need to operate. This can be things like database URLs, API endpoints, or simple text settings.
    
* Easy Organization: They help keep your settings organized, making it simple to access and modify them.
    
* Works with Any Container: ConfigMaps are versatile and can be used with any containerized application in Kubernetes.

Secrets are like a secure vault on your spaceship, where you keep sensitive information safe from prying eyes.

## Why Secrets Matter:

* **Security First:** Secrets encrypt sensitive data like passwords, API keys, and certificates, making it extremely difficult for unauthorized folks to access.
    
* **Built-in Encryption:** Kubernetes automatically encrypts data stored in Secrets, adding an extra layer of protection.
    
* **Access Control:** You can control who gets access to Secrets, ensuring only authorized containers or users can get their hands on sensitive information.

## Task 1: Creating a ConfigMap

Let's start by creating a ConfigMap and integrating it into a Kubernetes deployment.

### Step 1: Create a ConfigMap

* You can create a ConfigMap using a file or the command line. Here's a simple command-line example:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create configmap my-config --from-literal=DATABASE_URL=example.com --from-literal=DEBUG=true -n <namespace-name>
    ```
    
* Create a configMap.yml file using vim / nano and apply it !!
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: mysql-config
      labels:
        app: todo
    data:
      MYSQL_DB: "todo-db"
    ```
    

### **Step 2: Update Deployment Configuration**

* Now, modify your deployment YAML file to include the ConfigMap. Add an `env` section under your container spec, referencing the keys such as <mark>env variable name , from where it will take the value (configMap) and pass the key and password</mark> from the ConfigMap:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: mysql
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: mysql
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: mysql
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: mysql
            image: mysql:8
            ports:
            - containerPort: 3306
            env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-secret
                  key: password/
    ```
    

### **Step 3: Apply the Updated Deployment**

* Apply your updated deployment using this command:
    
    <mark>We can use dry-run</mark> : without actually submitting it, you can preview the object that would be sent to your cluster.
    
    `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml --dry-run=client`
    
    `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace>`

### **Step 4: Verify the ConfigMap**

To ensure your ConfigMap is created correctly, check the status of ConfigMaps in your namespace:

* To apply it , we can use `kubectl apply -f configMap.yml -n <namespace>` or
    
    <mark>We can use dry-run</mark> : without actually submitting it, you can preview the object that would be sent to your cluster.
    
    `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml --dry-run=client`
    
    ```bash
    # apply the configMaps
    kubectl get configmaps -n <namespace-name>
    ```

## Task 2: Creating a Secret

Now, let's delve into creating a Secret to securely store sensitive data.

### **Step 1: Create a Secret**

* You can create a Secret using a file or the command line. Here's a basic command-line example:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic my-secret --from-literal=API_KEY=my-secret-key -n <namespace-name>
    ```
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: mysql-secret
    type: Opaque
    data:
      password: dHJhaW53aXRoc2h1YmhhbQ==
    ```
    
* To apply it , we can use `kubectl apply -f secret.yml -n <namespace>` or
    
    <mark>We can use dry-run</mark> : without actually submitting it, you can preview the object that would be sent to your cluster.
    
    `kubectl apply -f secret.yml --dry-run=client`
    

### **Step 2: Update Deployment Configuration**

* To use the Secret in your deployment, update your deployment YAML file. Add an `env` section under your container spec, referencing the Secret's key:
    
    ```yaml
    
            - name: MYSQL_DATABASE
              valueFrom:
                configMapKeyRef:
                  name: mysql-config
                  key: MYSQL_DB
    ```
    
* Add the above in the deployment.yml and apply it !!
    

### **Step 3: Apply the Updated Deployment**

* Apply the updated deployment using the same command as before:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace-name>
    ```
    
* Apply your updated deployment using this command:
    
    <mark>We can use dry-run</mark> : without actually submitting it, you can preview the object that would be sent to your cluster.
    
    `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml --dry-run=client`
    
    `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n <namespace>`
    

### **Step 4: Verify the Secret**

* To make sure your Secret is created successfully, check the status of Secrets in your namespace:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets -n <namespace-name>
    ```
