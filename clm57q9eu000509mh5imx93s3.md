# **üï∏Ô∏è What is Ingress in Kubernetes‚ÅâÔ∏è**

In Kubernetes, Ingress is an API object used to manage external access to services within a cluster. It acts as a smart router or traffic manager for incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic, allowing you to define rules for how traffic should be directed to different services based on factors like hostnames, paths, and more. Think of Ingress as a gateway that controls how external traffic flows into your Kubernetes cluster.

**Ingress is valuable for several reasons:**

1. **Centralized Routing:** Instead of exposing each service individually to the internet, Ingress provides a centralized entry point for routing traffic. This simplifies external access management and reduces complexity.
    
2. **Path-Based Routing:** Ingress allows you to route traffic to different services based on URL paths. For example, you can route traffic to `/app1` to one service and `/app2` to another, all using a single external IP address and port.
    
3. **Host-Based Routing:** You can route traffic to different services based on hostnames (domain names). This is useful for hosting multiple websites or applications on the same cluster, each with its own domain.
    
4. **Load Balancing:** Ingress controllers often include built-in load balancing, distributing traffic evenly among pods in a service. This improves application availability and scalability.
    
5. **TLS Termination:** Ingress can handle SSL/TLS termination, allowing you to encrypt traffic between clients and the Ingress controller. This simplifies SSL certificate management for your services.
    

# üï∏Ô∏èHands-On For Understanding

* Let's create a Reddit clone on Kubernetes with ingress enabled
    

## **Prerequisites**

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on an Ubuntu EC2 instance:

* EC2 instance with Ubuntu (AMI: Ubuntu, Type: t2.medium)
    
* Docker
    
* Minikube
    
* kubectl
    

Here we make use of two servers , one is <mark>CI server</mark> (uset t2.micro) for getting the code from github , building the image and then pushing it to the docker hub !!

On <mark>deployment server </mark> (use t2.medium to make it more scalable) ,we setup Kubernetes which will make our reddit-clone-application more **<mark>Scalable</mark>**

## CI-Server:

### **Step 1: Clone the Source Code** First

You need to clone the source code for the Reddit clone application from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srahul0502/reddit-clone-k8s-ingress.git
```

### **Step 2: Containerize the Application using Docker**

This step involves creating a Docker image for your application. You'll need to create a Dockerfile with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:14-alpine

WORKDIR /reddit-clone

COPY . /reddit-clone

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

Then, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <DockerHub_Username>/<Imagename> .
```

Replace `<DockerHub_Username>` and `<Imagename>` with your Docker Hub username and the desired image name.

### **Step 3: Push the Image to DockerHub**

Push the Docker image to DockerHub so that Kubernetes can access it. First, log in to your DockerHub account:

```bash
docker login
# it will ask for username and password
```

Then, push the image:

```bash
docker push <DockerHub_Username>/<Imagename>
```

## Deployment-Server:

### **Step 4: Write Kubernetes Manifest Files** In Kubernetes

You define your application and its configuration using YAML files. You'll need to create two YAML files: `Deployment.yml` and `Service.yml`.

Here's an example of `Deployment.yml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-deployment
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reddit-clone
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: reddit-clone
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: reddit-clone
        image: <DockerHub_Username>/<Imagename>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

And here's an example of `Service.yml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-service
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - port: 3000
    targetPort: 3000
    nodePort: 31000
  selector:
    app: reddit-clone
```

### **Step 5: Deploy the Application to Kubernetes**

Now, deploy your application to Kubernetes using the following commands:

```bash
kubectl apply -f Deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f Service.yml
```

You can check the status of your deployment and service using these commands:

```bash
kubectl get deployment
kubectl get services
```

### **Step 6: Configure Ingress**

Ingress is used to route external traffic to your Kubernetes services. Create an `ingress.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-reddit-app
spec:
  rules:
  - host: "domain.com" # Replace with your domain or IP address
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/test"
        backend:
          service:
            name: reddit-clone-service
            port:
              number: 3000
  - host: "*.domain.com" # Replace with your domain or IP address
    http:
      paths:
      - pathType: Prefix
        path: "/test"
        backend:
          service:
            name: reddit-clone-service
            port:
              number: 3000
```

Enable Ingress in Minikube (if not already enabled):

```bash
minikube addons enable ingress
```

* Minikube doesn't automatically activate the Ingress feature by default; you need to enable it explicitly using the command `minikube addons enable ingress`.
    
* If you want to inspect the current status of Minikube's addons, you can use the command `minikube addons list`.
    
* Once Ingress is enabled, you can proceed to create an Ingress resource for your service using `kubectl apply -f ingress.yml`. This step sets up the routing rules for external traffic.
    
* To confirm that the Ingress resource is correctly configured and operational, you can run the command `kubectl get ingress ingress-reddit-app`. This command will provide information about the Ingress resource's status and configuration.
    

Apply the Ingress configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
```

Check the status of the Ingress:

```bash
kubectl get ingress ingress-reddit-app
```

### **Step 7: Expose the Application**

Expose your deployment using the following command:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment reddit-clone-deployment --type=NodePort
```

* This command is used to create a network route to a service. In this case, it's creating a route to the `reddit-clone-deployment` deployment.
    
* `--type=NodePort` specifies the type of service you want to expose. NodePort is one type that exposes a specific port on every Node in the cluster.

You can access your application using the Minikube IP and NodePort:

```bash
curl -L http://<Minikube_IP>:<NodePort>
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1693850322508/5cf12296-7ae6-48f7-bb81-14f56988e69d.png align="center")

* You can test your deployment using curl -L &lt;minikube-ip&gt; is a minikube ip & Port **31000** is defined in Service.yml
    
* Then We have to expose our app service
    
    ```yaml
    kubectl port-forward svc/reddit-clone-service 3000:3000 --address 0.0.0.0 &
    ```

### **Step 8: Test Ingress**

Test your Ingress configuration using the following command (replace `domain` with your domain or IP):

```bash
curl -L http://domain/test
```

* You should also be able to access your deployed application using your EC2 instance's IP address and port 3000. Make sure you've opened port 3000 in your EC2 instance's security group.
