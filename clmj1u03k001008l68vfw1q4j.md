Welcome to the world of Terraform! In this beginner-friendly guide, you'll embark on a journey to discover how Terraform can transform your cloud infrastructure tasks into manageable code. We've divided this guide into three tasks to help you get started with provisioning an AWS EC2 instance and automating its configuration.

# Defining Cloud Resources

In this we'll be creating a Terraform Configuration File to Define a Resource of AWS EC2 instance and understand the configuration file

**Step 1: Install Terraform**

If you haven't already, start by installing Terraform on your local machine. You can download it from the official website: [https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694624741963/00a46747-493d-47f4-ad94-2361fcc0742d.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694627540436/14e39d53-4275-41fb-991b-a7987ad37c3e.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694627557282/def63911-28ae-4b6f-bb7f-f798cd2f317f.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694627571060/d53977f8-456b-4f94-be5d-bd6712f6798e.png align="center")

**Step 2: Create a Project Directory**

Create a directory for your Terraform project. This directory will contain your configuration files.

```bash
mkdir terraform-project
cd terraform-project
```

Step 3: Configure AWS CLI

Before you can use Terraform to provision AWS resources, you need to configure the AWS CLI with your access key and secret key. If you haven't already configured the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

```bash
aws configure
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694627737233/0fe34a42-0793-4831-a64e-45bdbd92a684.png align="center")

You will be prompted to enter your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, default region name, and default output format. Enter the appropriate values when prompted.  

Refer this [blog](https://srdev.hashnode.dev/iam-programmatic-access-and-aws-cli) to understand how to create access key

**Step 4: Create an SSH Key Pair with ssh-keygen**

Next, you need to create an SSH key pair using `ssh-keygen`. Run the following command to generate an SSH key pair:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694628224383/fff22ea2-a66c-4df9-b634-1dc20b5f8d9a.png align="center")

This command will generate an RSA key pair and save it in two files: my-key (the private key) and [my-key.pub](http://my-key.pub) (the public key). Keep the private key (my-key) secure and do not share it. You'll use the public key ([my-key.pub](http://my-key.pub)) to associate with your EC2 instance.

**Step 5: Create a Terraform Configuration File**

Create a file named [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) in your project directory. This file will contain the Terraform configuration for an AWS EC2 instance.

```bash
touch main.tf
```

Now, open [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) in a text editor and add the following content:

Inside [main.tf](http://main.tf), you can specify the cloud resources you want to create. For instance, let's create an AWS EC2 instance:

```bash
provider "aws" {
   region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my-instance" {

    ami = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"  
    instance_type = "t2.micro" 
    key_name= "aws_key"
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.main.id]
	
	tags = {
    Name = "Terra_Instance"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "main" {
  egress = [
    {
      cidr_blocks      = [ "0.0.0.0/0", ]
      description      = ""
      from_port        = 0
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = []
      prefix_list_ids  = []
      protocol         = "-1"
      security_groups  = []
      self             = false
      to_port          = 0
    }
  ]
  ingress = [
    {
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      description      = ""
      from_port        = 22
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = []
      prefix_list_ids  = []
      protocol         = "tcp"
      security_groups  = []
      self             = false
      to_port          = 22
    },
    {
      cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
      description      = ""
      from_port        = 80  # Port 80 for HTTP
      ipv6_cidr_blocks = []
      prefix_list_ids  = []
      protocol         = "tcp"
      security_groups  = []
      self             = false
      to_port          = 80
    }
  ]
}

resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer" {
  key_name   = "aws_key"
  public_key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDSyunVs1WPGqlOXWkWZwkLUiQ0jasGYoRAhyPfvbO3jv0bSwYksTGtUjDr0mrW2DtrE0jv55sUOGQRTBwTIe5mC7EcOiG/aN64hOf6hxFKdVMoRQ8Cahu7jsSjm8CV4+HVGDtZg6QRrkIIcWFw4UXkUzZ/z0CMnkpvCivrhMg5cQDMsp/7quC2Q7yf6Z7vKqdE2d9YufurtSW4SUBKCUjhIun1OGtskhiDXsQDU0kncAvZOJO1ru3djhvsFGRKY71cf8hFzkfrzB5AKcsgtEsNJ7cLYzZe30zR5apv0XhA2XRqzqcK8sVl/kQWo+b2LanZNc/pYdyV1dQ131dbm6+/ srahul@DESKTOP-0DTGRRD"
}
```

Let's break down the detailed steps of what each resource does in the provided Terraform configuration:

1. **Provider Block (**`provider "aws"`)
    
    * **What it does:** This block configures the AWS provider and specifies the desired AWS region for resource provisioning.
        
    * **Settings:**
        
        * `region`: Sets the AWS region to "us-east-1," indicating where the resources will be created.
            
    
    **2\. AWS EC2 Instance Resource (**`resource "aws_instance" "my-instance"`)
    
    * **What it does:** This resource creates an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, which is a virtual server in AWS.
        
    * **Settings:**
        
        * `ami`: Specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID ("ami-053b0d53c279acc90") to determine the instance's operating system and software.
            
        * `instance_type`: Sets the instance type to "t2.micro," providing a small, cost-effective instance.
            
        * `key_name`: Associates the instance with the AWS Key Pair named "aws\_key" for SSH access.
            
        * `vpc_security_group_ids`: Specifies the security group(s) associated with the instance (in this case, "aws\_security\_group.main.id").
            
        * `tags`: Adds a tag to the instance for easy identification, naming it "Terra\_Instance."
            
    * **Provisioners:**
        
        * `file` Provisioner: Transfers a script from the local machine to the instance. It copies "/home/srahul/script.sh" to "/home/ubuntu/script.sh" on the remote instance.
            
        * `remote-exec` Provisioner: Executes inline commands on the remote instance, including changing permissions on the script and running it.
            
    * **Connection Block:**
        
        * Specifies the SSH connection details to access the instance, including the private key, username ("ubuntu"), and host (instance's public IP).
            
        * `timeout` sets the maximum connection timeout to 4 minutes.
            
    * **Lifecycle Block:**
        
        * `create_before_destroy` is set to true, ensuring that a new instance is created before the old one is destroyed when making changes.
            
    
    **3\. Security Group Resource (**`resource "aws_security_group" "main"`)
    
    * **What it does:** This resource defines an AWS security group, which acts as a virtual firewall to control incoming and outgoing network traffic.
        
    * **Settings:**
        
        * `egress`: Defines an egress rule that allows all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) from the instance.
            
        * `ingress`: Defines two ingress rules:
            
            * Rule 1: Allows incoming SSH traffic (port 22) from any source (0.0.0.0/0).
                
            * Rule 2: Allows incoming HTTP traffic (port 80) from any source (0.0.0.0/0).
                
    
    **4\. AWS Key Pair Resource (**`resource "aws_key_pair" "deployer"`)
    
    * **What it does:** This resource creates an AWS Key Pair, which is used for secure SSH access to EC2 instances.
        
    * **Settings:**
        
        * `key_name`: Sets the name of the key pair to "aws\_key."
            
        * `public_key`: Specifies the public key for the key pair.
            
    
    This Terraform configuration sets up an EC2 instance with the specified AMI, instance type, security group rules, and SSH key pair. It also transfers and executes a script on the instance during provisioning. The security group rules allow SSH and HTTP traffic to the instance, while the lifecycle block ensures safe instance replacement during updates.
    

These resources work together to create an AWS EC2 instance with SSH access and proper network security settings.

**Step 3: Initialize the Project**

Initialize your Terraform project by running the following command in your project directory:

```bash
terraform init
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694628932501/b740255b-3ba6-4a86-abef-6eb81b3d0b61.png align="center")

This command initializes Terraform and downloads the necessary plugins for the AWS provider.

## Preparing for Deployment

**Step 5: Check State Files**

Before applying any changes, it's a good practice to check the state files to understand what resources Terraform is managing. Run the following command:

```bash
terraform state list
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686947743/da152b75-e275-4f53-b33e-2f2b45d75030.png align="center")

This command will list the resources that Terraform knows about.

'terraform state' list provides you with a clear list of all the cloud resources you've worked with using Terraform. It's like making sure you have all the right LEGO pieces before you start building your next masterpiece.

**Step 6: Validate the Configuration**

Validate your Terraform configuration for syntax errors and other issues:

```bash
terraform validate
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694629333918/5ff2fb33-b244-4305-abba-16880f8e6240.png align="center")

This command checks the syntax and structure of your configuration file and ensures it's ready for deployment.

'terraform validate' is a helpful tool that checks your Terraform code for mistakes and ensures it's ready to use when you want to create or update your cloud resources. It's like having a robot double-check your work to avoid problems down the road.

# Adding Provisioners

**Step 7: Add a Provisioner**

Provisioners allow you to configure resources after they are created. In this step, we'll add a provisioner to install Nginx on the EC2 instance.

Adding provisioners in Terraform is like casting magic spells on your cloud resources to make them do extra tasks after they're created. It's like having a team of wizards at your disposal to customize your resources just the way you want them.

Open [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) in your text editor and modify the `aws_instance` block as follows:

```bash
# main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "my-instance" {

    ami = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"  
    instance_type = "t2.micro" 
    key_name= "aws_key"
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.main.id]
	
	tags = {
    Name = "Terra_Instance"
  }

  provisioner "file" {
    source     = "/home/srahul/script.sh"
    destination = "/home/ubuntu/script.sh"
  }
# Provisioner for remote execution within the instance
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "chmod +x /home/ubuntu/script.sh",
      "/home/ubuntu/script.sh",
    ]
  }
  connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      host        = self.public_ip
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/home/srahul/Keys/aws_key")
      timeout     = "4m"
   }
}
```

These `provisioner` blocks specify that Terraform should run the provided commands on the EC2 instance after it's created.

In this case, we are installing and starting Nginx.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install nginx -y
sudo echo "This is running on infara provisioned by terraform " > /tmp/index.html
sudo cp /tmp/index.html /var/www/html/
sudo service nginx start
```

1. **Update Software Information:**
    
    * The script begins by making sure it has the most up-to-date information about available software.
        
2. **Install Nginx Web Server:**
    
    * It then installs a popular web server called "Nginx" on your computer.
        
3. **Create a Simple Web Page:**
    
    * Next, it creates a basic web page that says, "This is running on infrastructure provisioned by Terraform." Think of it like writing a message on a blank piece of paper.
        
4. **Prepare the Web Page:**
    
    * This step puts the message onto the web server. Imagine placing the paper message into a folder where others can see it.
        
5. **Start the Web Server:**
    
    * Finally, it turns on the web server so that it's ready to share your web page with anyone who wants to see it.
        

**Step 8: Apply Changes**

Apply the changes to create the EC2 instance and run the provisioner:

```shell
terraform apply
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686289108/5f182d04-ea26-4148-bfe5-49f283a95a87.png align="center")

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686630152/ba7af536-a69b-458b-a279-4ba74be74143.png align="center")

**Instance Created**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686655820/4c6bbc9f-41bc-4cac-bb28-4ace4a306727.png align="center")

**Copy the public-ip and paste it in the browser**

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686685239/7d4c9f2f-819b-496c-97aa-81f9efe912a3.png align="center")

This command will prompt you to confirm the changes. Type "yes" to proceed.

# Adding Lifecycle Management

**Step 9: Add Lifecycle Configuration**

Lifecycle management allows you to control resource creation, modification, and deletion behavior. Let's add a `create_before_destroy` block to ensure a new resource is created before the old one is destroyed.

Open [`main.tf`](http://main.tf) in your text editor and modify the `aws_instance` block as follows:

```bash
# main.tf

# Include this is in the main.tf

# main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "my-instance" {

    ami = "ami-053b0d53c279acc90"  
    instance_type = "t2.micro" 
    key_name= "aws_key"
    vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.main.id]
	
	tags = {
    Name = "Terra_Instance"
  }

  provisioner "file" {
    source     = "/home/srahul/script.sh"
    destination = "/home/ubuntu/script.sh"
  }
# Provisioner for remote execution within the instance
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "chmod +x /home/ubuntu/script.sh",
      "/home/ubuntu/script.sh",
    ]
  }
  connection {
      type        = "ssh"
      host        = self.public_ip
      user        = "ubuntu"
      private_key = file("/home/srahul/Keys/aws_key")
      timeout     = "4m"
   }
}


  # Add a lifecycle block for create-before-destroy
  lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
  }
}
```

This `lifecycle` block ensures that a new EC2 instance is created before the old one is destroyed when changes are applied.

Adding lifecycle management in Terraform is like giving instructions to your cloud resource gardener (Terraform) on how to plant and remove resources in your garden (cloud infrastructure). It ensures that changes happen smoothly, and resources are replaced without causing disruptions.

"Create Before Destroy" and "Prevent Destroy" are two distinct strategies used in Terraform for managing resource lifecycle behavior.

**Create Before Destroy:**

* **Explanation:** This strategy ensures that when you make changes to your infrastructure, Terraform first creates new resources with the desired configuration before destroying the old ones. It helps ensure a smooth transition.
    
* **Example:** Imagine you have a web server. With Create Before Destroy, Terraform would launch a new server with updated settings before shutting down the old one. This minimizes downtime.
    

**Prevent Destroy:**

* **Explanation:** This approach adds a layer of protection to specific resources, preventing Terraform from accidentally deleting them. It's useful for critical resources you want to safeguard.
    
* **Example:** Let's say you have a database that should never be deleted accidentally. By using Prevent Destroy, you can configure Terraform to refuse any destroy operations on that database.
    

These simplified explanations aim to make the concepts more accessible to beginners by using plain language and relatable examples.

# Apply Changes and Destroy Resources

Apply the changes to test the create-before-destroy behavior:

```shell
terraform apply
```

And to destroy the resources:

```shell
terraform destroy
```

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1694686929137/4f1401cf-86a9-46b5-bdeb-6d2c6109d223.png align="center")

That's it! You've completed the four tasks for managing cloud resources with Terraform. You can adapt these concepts to other cloud providers like Azure or Google Cloud by changing the provider and resource types in your configuration file. Terraform provides a powerful and flexible way to automate and manage your infrastructure, making it an invaluable tool for DevOps and cloud engineers.
